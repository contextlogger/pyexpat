This is the source distribution of a Symbian port of ``pyexpat``. It
contains patches to the "mainline" versions of Expat and ``pyexpat``,
as well as some build-related files and documentation.

Prior to attempting a build, do note that

  1. You need to have the full source trees of both Expat and
     ``pyexpat`` Symbian ports. See the scripts
     ``construct-expat-source.sh`` and ``construct-pyexpat-source.sh``
     for information on how to reconstruct the source trees.

  2. You need to have a Symbian C++ SDK installed. The software has
     been tested to build with versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the Series 60 SDK.

  3. You need to have Python header files in the location specified in
     the ``pyexpat.mmp`` file. If not, either put them there, or edit
     the MMP file to reflect the correct location.

  4. The PKG files assume that you are using the -d switch to specify
     the path to your chosen SDK. Alternatively, you could edit the PKG 
     files, and specify absolute paths for all the source files.

To build, simply issue the command

  build

or, under a Cygwin shell,

  ./build.bat

This will build an ARMI UREL SIS file, as well as WINS UDEB binaries.

Building WINS binaries has only been tested with the MSVC compiler,
and it is unknown whether builds would be successful also using, say,
a Borland compiler.
