pyexpat for PyS60

%%mtime(%c)

This is the distribution of a Symbian port of ``pyexpat``. It contains
patches to the "mainline" versions of Expat and ``pyexpat``, as well
as some build-related files and documentation. For more information
about the patches, see the ``doc`` directory.

The Symbian-specific build scripts build SIS files that contain both
the pyexpat native extension, and the ``xml`` module (as extracted
from the Python distribution). Note that just the ``pyexpat``
extension is not necessarily enough to make all of the functionality
in the ``xml`` module work; other Python libraries or native
extensions may be required for full functionality.

Licensing information for Expat and ``pyexpat`` can be found from the
``expat-*-*`` and ``pyexpat-*-*`` directories. Any HIIT modifications
to these are covered by the original licenses. Any HIIT additions
(such as builds and test scripts) are covered by the MIT license.

Builds have been made with a variety of different SDK versions, and there should be a suitable build for just about any S60 device.
